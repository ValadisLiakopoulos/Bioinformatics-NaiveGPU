# Bioinformatics - Naive Exact Pattern Matching GPU Accelerated
This program can do parallel naive pattern matching in a DNA/RNA sequence
## This program only calculates occurrence of a pattern and doesn't store the positions
## TODO
### 1. Dynamic block initialization in the device
### 2. Store position of every occurrence
